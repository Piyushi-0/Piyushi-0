- 🔭 I’m currently trying on problems in DP and Stochastic Optimization in the context of OT. I've found that theoretical problems in *online learning* resonate the most with me. Hope to finish my [reading list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19vLDq3B6msAqTOdwmisl6VTUA8Jw2LB7Q051atHxFPA/edit?usp=sharing) before I switch completely.
- 🌱 Books that I’m currently targeting are [MARL](https://www.marl-book.com/download/marl-book.pdf) & [Statistical OT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18163).
- ⌨️ [Raschka's LLMs-from-scratch](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch) for my implementational practice.
- 🤝 Looking to collaborate on AI-for-healthcare.
- 💁 Looking for help with empirical evaluation of some of my OT-based research ideas.

- Amusing Fact: The preface of [ltfp](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/ltfp_book.pdf) has a great placement for my name 🙂.
